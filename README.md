# VerdiX - Blockchain-Based Carbon Platform

**VerdiX** is an open-source Web3 platform that enables farmers to plant trees, absorb CO₂, verify their efforts, and tokenize them as NFTs (carbon certificates). Companies can purchase these NFTs using VerdiX Tokens to offset their carbon footprint.

## Project Status
- **MVP in Progress**: Currently building the core smart contracts and frontend.

## Key Features
- **TreeNFT**: ERC-721 NFTs representing verified tree plantings and their CO₂ absorption.
- **VerdiXToken**: ERC-20 token for payments within the VerdiX ecosystem.
- **MRV (Measurement, Reporting, Verification)**: Transparent process to verify carbon sequestration.
- **Frontend**: React + Tailwind-based landing page for user interaction.

## Folder Structure
- `/contracts/`: Solidity smart contracts (`TreeNFT.sol`, `VerdiXToken.sol`).
- `/frontend/`: React + Tailwind frontend (`App.jsx`).
- `/docs/`: Technical documentation for MRV and tokenization.
- `/scripts/`: Deployment scripts for local testing.
- `/test/`: Unit tests using Chai and Hardhat.
