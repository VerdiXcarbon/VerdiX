# ðŸŒ± VerdiX â€” Whitepaper v1.0
*The Carbon Marketplace Powered by Blockchain & Farmers*

## 1. Executive Summary
The global carbon credit market is in crisis, with an estimated $50 billion industry undermined by unverifiable certificates, greenwashing, and inefficient systems. Smallholder farmers, who hold the key to reforestation, are largely excluded due to high costs and centralized barriers, while corporations struggle to find trustworthy offsets. VerdiX addresses these challenges with a transparent, Web3-powered platform that tokenizes verified carbon absorption into NFTs, empowering farmers and enabling companies to offset emissions with confidence. As of June 22, 2025, VerdiX is poised to launch its MVP in Q3 2025, marking a new era in carbon trading.

## 2. The Problem
Key issues in todayâ€™s carbon market include:
- Fake or unverifiable certificates
- Greenwashing by major corporations
- High verification costs
- Smallholder farmers excluded from access
- Centralized, slow systems

## 3. The VerdiX Solution
VerdiX offers a unique value proposition:
- Tokenization of verified carbon absorption
- Carbon NFTs with flexible tonnage
- Payment using $VERX Token
- MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) entirely on-chain

## 4. How It Works
The VerdiX process is streamlined for impact:
1. Farmers plant trees
2. Data is collected (photos, sensors, satellite)
3. MRV smart contract verifies COâ‚‚ absorbed
4. Carbon NFT is minted (e.g., 10.2 tons)
5. Companies purchase the NFT
6. Farmers are paid in $VERX Token
7. NFT serves as public ESG proof

## 5. MRV System
The VerdiX MRV system uses advanced technology for efficiency:
- IoT Sensors: Monitors tree health in real-time.
- Satellite and Drone Imagery: Validates planting and growth.
- Farmer-Submitted Data: Photos and logs ensure community input.
Compared to legacy bodies like Verra, VerdiXâ€™s on-chain MRV is faster (days vs. months), cheaper (up to 70% cost reduction), and fully transparent.

## 6. Carbon NFT Design
Each VerdiX Carbon NFT includes:
- GPS location
- Tree species
- Timestamp and planting details
- Exact COâ‚‚ absorbed (no rounding)
- Photos and metadata
NFTs act as verifiable digital certificates, usable in ESG reports and public dashboards.

## 7. Pricing & Token Model
- NFT prices follow global carbon market rates ($5â€“30/ton)
- Payment is made in $VERX Token, pegged to the real-time USD value
- Farmers receive $VERX Token as rewards (e.g., 1 token per 1 ton COâ‚‚)
- Price oracle updates NFT value in real-time
- **Platform Fee**: 5% of each NFT sale to support ecosystem growth
**Example**: A farmer in West Java plants trees, absorbing 10.2 tons COâ‚‚. They receive 10.2 $VERX Tokens. VerdiX mints an NFT, a company buys it at $10/ton = $102. The platform takes a 5% fee ($5.10), and the farmer earns $96.90 + 10.2 $VERX Tokens.

## 8. Use Case Simulation
**Scenario**: A farmer in Indonesia plants 50 trees in June 2025.
- Step 1: Data shows 15.3 tons COâ‚‚ absorbed.
- Step 2: MRV smart contract verifies on-chain.
- Step 3: A 15.3-ton NFT is minted.
- Step 4: A company buys it at $15/ton = $229.50.
- Step 5: Platform fee (5%) = $11.48, farmer receives $218.02 + 15.3 $VERX Tokens.
- Benefits: Farmer gains income, company offsets emissions, public gets ESG transparency.

## 9. Roadmap
- Q3 2025: MVP development (starting July 2025)
- Q4 2025: Pilot projects with farmers
- Q1 2026: $VERX Token listing
- Q2 2026: Mainnet launch

## 10. Our Vision
VerdiX combines social impact, climate justice, and blockchain to build a fair carbon economy. We empower smallholder farmers with income, combat greenwashing with transparent NFTs, and open access to all. Our vision is a sustainable future where every tree planted drives equity, restores ecosystems, and heals the planet.
